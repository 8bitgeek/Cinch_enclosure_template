This is the Cinch Enclosure layout template for the 60 pins Cinch enclosure. It includes the Case, left and right spring brackets, and the 60 pin connector that includes lots of great layout details. The 3D was provided by Modice and is not the offical copy, it is current at the time this was created, but it could get out of date.
