This is a Cinch ModeICE enclosure layout template. The intent is that this will function as a starting point containing the critical items of an engine management system, such that one can insert thier CPU of choice and much of the hardware layout ect has already been drafted.

It includes the enclosure with thermal bars, left and right spring brackets, and a couple of potentail connectors that includes lots of great layout details. Included are the OEM Cinch 60 pin harness connector, and a Molex 112 pin connector.

The 3D of the enclosure was provided by Modice and is not the offical copy, it is current at the time this was created, but it could get out of date. The 3D assembly models are were often created in solidworks, and then imported to KICAD via TTConv0.2.
