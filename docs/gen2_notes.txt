Notes for gen2

Different harness connector, one that goes straight to the PCB, and has power devices dumping heat out the back. Perhaps with 2 connectors such that analog stuff can appraoch the processor in a start config. 

install the SP720 and SP723 earlier on, such that they are included.

Modularize parts if it like th injectocts, such that sub boards can be bulk processed. For example, 4 low side drive, or the WO2 circuit.

change AN/DIGI protect parts to smaller SMT, such that they can be packed tighter together.
